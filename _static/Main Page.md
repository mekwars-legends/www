BECOME A LEGEND...
"I remember when it was announced almost 30 years ago. The Federated Commonwealth; they said it was the beginning of a new era of prosperity for the Lyran people. I was 18 then, bright-eyed, and eager to serve in what we Lyrans thought would be a new Star League. I believed it when the Archon told us peace had come. That was four wars ago for me.

Looking back I wonder if some god somewhere is trying to punish us for our hubris. My brother Karl died fighting the Clans 16 years ago. The Civil War came, and my brother Otto died fighting the Fedsuns. My brother Aramis died - fighting me. 

I am 45 years old now, whats left of me. I have more mechanical parts then my Fafnir. Word just came from regimental HQ - we are heading out to the front against the Falcons. Perhaps soon I will join my brothers. Perhaps soon I will know if there is a Valhalla."

- The journal of Hauptmann Benjamin Von Bertuz, 5th Donegal Guards


It is 3068. The Inner Sphere is in flames. The Whitting Confrerence ended with the dissolution of the Second Star League mankinds most recent attempt to unify our fractious species. Enraged by the loss of the reborn  Star League it had hoped to join the Word of Blake has turned the mighty army it built to destroy the clans upon the quarreling nations of the Inner Sphere. Already the Blakists control parts of Tharkad, New Avalon and Luthien and their puppet government controls parts of Atreus.

Elsewhere the fractious Inner Sphere fights one another. The Davion Capellan March strikes at the resurgent Capellan Confederation, While the Draconis March eyes the tempting targets accross the thinly guarded Combine border. Meanwhile the Lyrans battle for their lives as the clans storm across the Inner Sphere towards Terra. The FWL finds itself embroiled in conflicts with it's blakist "allies" and striking to punish the tratiorous Lyrans.  The Draconis Combine is assaulted from within and from all sides as clan forces descend on the peaceful Outworlds Alliance. 

To those that call the Inner Sphere home, it is an Age of War, An Age of Chaos, and an Age of Opportunity. People will fall, nations will rise. Will you be forgotten? Or will you become... A Legend?
