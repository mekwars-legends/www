CAMPAIGN HALL OF HEROES
History is important. Remembering the past campaigns will make you laugh, cry or even shake your head.

To every campaign there is a winner, let the victors claim their well earned glory, let those they have defeated aspire to future victories.

The top four factions of each campaign are honored in the Campaign Hall of Heroes. The Hall of Heroes act as a sort of "Hall of Fame" for the Mekwars: Legends campaigns. In the end the Hall of Heroes are the server Staff's small tribute to the perseverance and skill of the players who have made the Mekwars:Legends campaign so successful in the past and who breathe life into the statue of clay that is a campaign.
