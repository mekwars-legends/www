PLAYER DATA WINDOWS
On the right side of a players client there are two large information windows used to display data to the player - The Player List area and The Player Data area. Like the other areas of the client these windows may be adjusted in size by the user.

PLAYER LIST

The Player List area is exactly what it sounds like. It is a list of all the players that are currently logged in. The players are assigned a color appropriate to their faction. Players in battle are designated by a pair of crossed swords. Hovering the mouse cursor over a player will display a small information pop-up including the players experience points, their sub-faction and unit focus and any additional personal information that they wish to display along with their required forum name (commonly referred to as 'fluff'). Users may further interface with the Player list by right-clicking on a player on the list to call up an interaction menu with the following options:

MAIL (Player Name) - This will call up a window to send the player a private message.

SEND COMBAT POINTS - Used to send Combat points to the target player for supporting their claims in the strategic operations portion of the campaign.

BLOCK - selecting this will call up three sub menu choices Mute (Main): Mutes the player in the main channel for the user. Mute (Private): blocks all private messages from the target player to the user No-Play: Adds the target player to the user's No-Play List.

DESCENDING ORDER - Toggles the player list being sorted by descending or ascending order.

SORT - Allows for the player list to be configured to be sorted by Name, Faction,Experience, Status ("in game" or not in game.), User Level, and Country (based off IP address)

LIST SETTINGS - Allows users to select what settings they would like to use for the list (not recommended that these are changed).
