COMBAT VEHICLES

Although the 'Mech was a breakthrough in battlefield technology it never fully replaced conventional vehicles, largely do to the great expense of the former and the cost effectiveness and ease of manufacture of the latter. To this day conventional vehicles or "Vees" remain an important part of the 31st century battlefield.

Vehicles are classified into three broad categories for purposes of the army composition rules. The  categories are as follows:

<br>-Combat Vehicles - These include any vehicle that is not classified as a VTOL or an Armored Transport.
<br>-VTOL - This category includes any WiGE and VTOL unit.
<br>-Armored Transports -  Any vehicle with 4 or more tons of cargo space is classified as an Armored Transport. 


The following rules apply to vehicle deployment:

COMBAT VEHICLES: Anytime vehicles are deployed they do not count towards the 50% rule. Unless otherwise noted players may only deploy one vehicle for every two mechs in their army. Rasalhague Republic (CGRK) and Word of Blake players may deploy one Combat Vehicle per mech in their army. Combined Arms focus players may deploy Combat Vehicles in their army without any restrictions.

VTOLS: VTOL units are a special case, even if also classified as a transport unit. Players may deploy one VTOL for every commander in their army. VTOL do not count toward army eligibility in any other way, unless otherwise noted. 

ARMORED TRANSPORTS: Additionally, any Vehicle with 4 or more tons of cargo space is classified as a transports. Transports may not be deployed without at least one corresponding battle armor or conventional infantry unit per transport. Transports do not count toward army eligibility in any other way, unless otherwise noted.
