ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

As a general rule Mekwars: Legends believes that the server and the community should come before any individual agenda. The credo of this server is that this campaign belongs to "no one" and "everyone" at the same time.

However, needless to say there are many who have worked and continue to work behind the scenes. On a several occasions individuals have provided their time and talents "above and beyond" the norm. They remain among us, fixing things that are broke, providing their intelligence and skill to give us a place to play.
