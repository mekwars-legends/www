TACTICAL OPERATIONS

The holo tank spun fluid images of three dimensional light inside the Mobile HQ. Colonel Francher paced around the display while his staff scratched their chins and the backs of their heads. A red wedge of DCMS troops moved at a snail’s pace through the river delta completely unaware of the yellow square of AFFS mechs squatting in the crevasse beside them. Francer had put considerable thought into putting this flanking action together. He had hand selected the men and machines needed to pull off this attack and get clear before the Dracs could respond.
The “GO” signal lit the yellow square a bright shade as it moved swiftly on a collision course with the enemy.
“Winning this world one battle at a time.” Francher blurted.  “One bloody battle at a time.” 

Tactical Operations are the life-blood of the campaign. While factions make far reaching and important campaign decisions with Strategic Operations, it is the Tactical Operations, the ground and aerospace battles played out via the Megamek client , that deliver the decisive results of the campaign-- control of worlds. Armies are built and destroyed, worlds won and lost, and hours of fun and memories are created during the course of a cycle's many Tactical Operations.
 
The Tactical Operations are designed to be intuitive and straight forward, simulating the struggle for control of a planet in equal parts concrete and abstract. At the core, these operations are meant to be utilized as the primary means of conquest in the campaign. These are not low intensity border raids, but rather "snapshots" of full scale battles in which a faction deploys its better regiments to dominate a theatre of war.

There are three crucial components required for a Tactical Operation:

<br>-A player requires an army or force with which to fight the operation constructed from available units in the player's headquarters. The Minimum army BV for a Tactical Operation on Mekwars: Legends is 8000 BV. 
<br>-A player requires an opponent with an army near his BV or Rating modified BV (see House Rules) to engage. 
<br>-A player requires that this opponent to have a target planet within range of a friendly Logistics Center. Note: some special Tactical Operations require players have earned a reward point (gained after completing the requirements to end a Tactical Campaign) to launch. 


Once these criteria are met a player can initiate a tactical operation by way of the matchmaking system. The chart below details the operation types.

It is essential for players to familiarize themselves with the rules for Tactical Operations by exploring the menu to the left.  Army composition rules as well as the rules concerning finding, starting, playing and ending games before attempting to engage the enemy can all be found through exploration of the menu. Additionally the types of operations as well as an overview of the Tactical Campaign system must be considered required reading for players in the campaign. Enjoy!
