![falcon](../_img/jadefalcon.jpg)![wolf](../_img/wolf.jpg)CRUSADER CLANS

For fifteen years the Wolf and the Falcon have been sharpening their claws. Humbled, but definitely not cowed by a humiliating dezgra victory brought about by the dishonorable Comguard and traitorous Ulric Kerensky. Now the truce has expired and armed with new weapons, newer tactics and the finest warriors the Inner Sphere has ever seen the collective might of Clan Jade Falcon and Clan Wolf stand ready to finally retake Terra and restore the true Star League. The Crusaders will complete Kerensky's dream and woe betide any Lyran, Blakist or Draconian who attempts to stand between them and their prize.
