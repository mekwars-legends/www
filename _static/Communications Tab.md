Communication is an important part of the campaign, whether it is to allies, enemies, staff members or any other individuals that are participating in the campaign. Most of the communication that goes on will go on through text in one of several communications tabs. The Tabs and their uses are listed bellow: 

THE CHATTERWEB: What you type in the ChatterWeb tab will be broadcast to the entire server, appearing in what is commonly referred to as "main channel" or simply "main". The main channel is used to casually chat, arrange games when needed and discuss things pertaining to the campaign. Additionally important feedback from the server when you are matched for a game appears in this channel. Players should attempt to avoid flaming or complaining about players or factions in this channel. 

FACTION HPG: What you type in this tab will be broadcast only to your faction in the "Faction channel" or 'faction Chat" as it is commonly called. You may display armies and units in this channel for faction members to comment on and when you begin or end a game or receive a unit from a quartermaster request, a message will appear in this channel notifying your faction. Posting others conversations from the faction channel to main channel without their consent is considered rude and should be avoided. 

ALTERNATE CHANNEL: This is a utility channel, mainly used for side discussions that are not appropriate for main channel. moderators may ask two players that are debating something in a heated manner in main channel to go to the alternate channel to continue their debate. At other times the channel may be used to hold informal server meetings and the like. 

PERSONAL LOG: This channel is pretty straightforward. It is a log of a players inputs and messages, able to be viewed only by that player. Not much else to say about it. 

INFORMATION: This tab opens to a channel similar to the personal log in that it can be viewed only by the individual player. It displays the output from several data commands available to the player via the top menus such as checking on pilot queues, a players status, the status of factions among other things. 

SERVER: Occasionally you will get a communication tab that appears with the title "server". This tab will relay messages to you that the server sent to you while logging off or disconnected. 

PRIVATE MESSAGE TABS: These tabs open up every time someone sends a player a private message effectively creating a channel for the two players. There is no active moderation of these temporary channels. However, the server's rules of conduct still apply
