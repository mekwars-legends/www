COMMANDERS
While it is the generals and Star Colonels that plan a campaign, it is the tactical commanders - the Lance and Star Commanders- that execute these plans and more often than not decide victory and defeat. Oftentimes the cohesion and teamwork that a tactical commander has fostered between his Lance or Level II while he leads them can make a unit twice as dangerous as it may be on paper. Likewise the loss of a commander can have a demoralizing effect on the unit throwing the best laid plans into disarray.

RULES FOR COMMANDERS

Players may designate one commander per canon formation in an army.

A canon unit formation is defined as follows:

For The Inner Sphere factions (other than the Word of Blake) -  a Lance (4 units) of Mechs.

For the Word of Blake  - a Level II (6 units), which may be comprised of Mechs, Vehicles or Battle Armor.

For the Clans - A Star (3 units) of mechs. 

Players with the Combined Arms unit focus may define four (4) vehicles as a canon unit formation for factions that use lances, if there are no mechs in the army.


DEPLOYING COMMANDERS:

<br>-The Commander must occupy a Mech from the highest weight-class in the army (Assault, Heavy,Medium, Light)
<br>-If an army has multiple commanders available, this process continues (each successive commander being designated in the highest available weightclass ‘mech) until there are no more ‘mechs available.
<br>-If no ‘mech is available the vehicle with the highest available weight-class may be designated a commander. 
<br>-VTOLs and Battle Armor may never be designated as a commander. 
<br>-If an army does not contain any canon unit formations that would allow a commander, a player may designate one commander for the army without meeting the canon formation requirement. (This includes aerospace armies – an army that consist of only aerospace may designate only a single commander).


Active commanders formations grant the army a +2 initiative bonus for the battle as long as they are functional (The unit is operational and not shut down or unconscious). The bonus is not cumulative if multiple commanders are present.
