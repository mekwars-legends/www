Choosing which faction you will fight for will probably be one of the most important choices you make during the campaign. Each of the ten main factions is represented by players who have choosen to defect to it. Together these players form a team that lends each other advice and makes strategic decisions together. The strategic decisions they make (the rules of which are outlined in the Strategic Operations section of this site) can have important and lasting influence on the campaign and can help turn an unsuccessful campaign into a successful one.

Some factions are larger bodies of politically independent sub-factions. When choosing a faction players must also inform the staff which sub-faction they will be playing for, upon which they will be assigned to that sub-faction. The sub-faction you choose oftentimes has a major influence on what equipment your unit is outfitted with as well as how many and what quality of pilots you may have. The playable subfactions for the 9th Campaign are listed below.

## The following rules also apply to all factions

Conduct in Faction - The reality is that a faction and its sub-factions may be filled with a variety of players that share a common goal for the campaign. While in an ideal world everyone would get along with everyone else, this obviously does not always happen. However, regardless of how members of a faction feel about each other a certain level of civility is expected to be maintained. Players are expected to follow the server Code of Conduct and refrain from harassing other players over losses. Additionally, players are not to post content of the faction mail tab or faction forums to main or private mail tabs or general forums.

## Changing Faction or Sub-Faction
Players are strongly encouraged to choose a faction and stick with it for the entire campaign through a factions inevitable high and low points. This is a very rewarding experience and good friendships often foster among faction members over a long campaign. However, sometimes a player has a desire to find a new faction. Players are encouraged to give this decision a good deal of thought. If a player has come to the eventual conclusion that a change in faction is necessary they must abide by the following rules:

* A player must contact an admin and get approval from said admin before changing factions, admins may or may not approve the transfer based on several factors.
* A player forfeits all units, pilots, and points of any kind when changing factions (or sub-factions within a faction). Ranking, however, will stay the same.
