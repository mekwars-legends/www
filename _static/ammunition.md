# Ammunition

In addition to the basic munitions used by weapon systems, each faction in Mekwars: Legends has access to unique munitions for various weapon systems used to wage war in the 31st century.  Mankind has been seeking to improve the abilities of its weaponry since we first picked up a rock and club, the factions that struggle for supremacy in the Battletech universe are no exceptions.

## Ammunition Loading Rules:

Ammunition is divided up into two categories for purpose of deployments: Special and common.

SPECIAL Ammo
    Refers to ammo that is limited in availability to members of specific factions based on whether that particular
    faction has access to ammunition factories of that ammo type.

COMMON Ammo
    Refers to munitions that are readily available to all factions in the campaign.

In each Combat unit, a player may load one ton* of SPECIAL ammo type per each corresponding ammunition factory of that munition that their faction has access to. Note: This restriction is regardless of weapon size, referring only to that specific type of ammunition (ie: Thunder LRM ammo).

SPECIAL AMMO includes the following**:
* Arrow IV FASCAM
* LRM Thunder
* LRM Thunder-Active
* LRM Swarm
* LRM I-Swarm
* LRM Semi-guided
* Precision Autocannon
* Armor-Piercing Autocannon
* Arrow IV Inferno
* LRM Follow The Leader
* I-Narc ECM
* I-Narc Haywire
