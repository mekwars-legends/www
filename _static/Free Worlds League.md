![fwlogo](../_img/FWL Logo.jpg)FREE WORLDS LEAGUE

An often fractious realm the Free Worlds League is actually the oldest of the Successor States and the only one to maintain 
a representative government. While the often contentious nature of the League's politics can lead enemies to underestimate the League one should not ignore its power.

Spared the ravages of the Clan Invasion the Free Worlds League (FWL) has emerged in the second half of the 31st century as an economic and military powerhouse. Its alliance with the Word of Blake brought cutting edge technology to the military of the FWL and the traditionally lacklustre performance of the Leagues military was reversed with the successes of Operation: Guerrero. 

The history of the league is one of long struggle between the aspirations of the Captain-Generals to restore the Star league and a parliment adept at using its control over funding to hamstring an overly dictatorial ruler. Under the current Captain-General Thomas Marik, Parliament and the Captain-General have worked as one, building the League into the pre-eminent industrial power of the Inner Sphere and establishing a new military united in its devotion to the FWL, 

Now though the fires of war burn. Treacherous Lyrans lurk on one border eager to destroy their economic competion. Meanwhile, the devious Caplleans remain ever vigilant for weakness in the FWL, Finally the Word of Blake has shown it's true colours and turned on the FWL and it's leadership. The FWL is strong but can it withstand pressure from without as well as within?
