# The Trinity Alliance

![Capellan Confederation](../_img/capellanConfederation.gif) Once considered barely worthy of the title "Great House", the Capellan Confederation has undergone a major transformation under the ambitious and calculating leadership of its current Chancellor, Sun-Tzu Liao.

Sun-Tzu's leadership has led to the adoption of the Xin Sheng or "New Birth" movement, a reorganization and revitalization of Capellan national pride across all elements of society, including the military and economic sectors. Xin Sheng has reaped immediate benefits with the newly reorganized Capellan Confederation Armed Forces recovering key worlds lost in the Fourth Succession War, including the formerly breakaway St. Ives Commonality.

The Confederation has expanded through diplomacy as well, with the Chancellors marriage to Naomi Centralla of Canopus leading to the Magistracy formally joining the Confederation in an alliance along with the reluctant Taurian Concordat. This joining of the three nations has led to a further strengthening of the CCAF and has expanded the economic base used to fuel Sun-Tzu's ambitions.

At the dawn of the Jihad, the Capellan Confederation finds itself at the height of its power. Militarily, economically and politically the Confederation has never been stronger. Still the Confederation must plot its future carefully, with hostilities against ever dangerous Federated Suns able to spark at anytime, and the ambitions of an equally powerful Free Worlds League setting the stage for another epic conflict.
