STAR MAP TAB
The "Star Map" is essentially the game board on which the campaign is played out at the strategic level. The planet systems of the Inner Sphere are faithfully represented and color coded to represent factional control on the dynamically changing map. A variety of tools exist as well for players to glean information from the map.

Left-clicking on the map will jump to the nearest planet to the mouse pointer. Additionally you may navigate the map by using a mouse scroll wheel to zoom in and out or right-clicking and holding to drag the map. If your mouse lacks a scroll wheel you may zoom in and out with the slider located in the upper right side of the map window.

A single right-click on the map will bring up an interface menu that will allow a user several options including: ![starmap](_img/0de932f4eb97a85ab2c31ac0b68c9605.png)
