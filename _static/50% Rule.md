THE 50% RULE
While certain famous Regiments or Clusters are armed predominantly with one weight-class or even type of mech, these are the exceptions. The vast majority of units TO&E are culled from the Medium and Heavy weight-classes, with the Heavy weight-class in particular forming the backbone of most regiments and clusters. The Medium weight-class once the workhorse, is now more and more encroaching on the specialty and recon roles of the light weight-class.

To better simulate the variety of forces deployed in battle a single army composition rule is in effect for all mechs in an army.

RULE: At least 50% of the total number of mechs in a given force must be from the medium and/or heavy weight classes. Note: The medium and heavy weight classes ignore the classification that the units may be registered under on the server, and instead follow the canon weight class determination.

In simple terms, this rule means that a minimum of 50% of the Mechs in each force must weigh between 40 and 75 tons.


RECAP OF THE 50% RULE:

<br>-All Mechs count toward the 50% rule
<br>-At least 50% of all units that count towards the 50% rule must be of the medium or heavy weight class (40 to 75 tons).
