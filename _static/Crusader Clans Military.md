The Crusader Clans' military is built on an unsteady alliance between Clan Jade Falcon and Clan Wolf. While the Wolves favour speed and tactical finesse the Jade Falcons favour firepower and jump mobility. Whether these two very different combat philosophies will complement each other remains to be seen. The Clans forces are divided between the front line clusters which make extensive use of omni-mechs and the second line clusters that are forced to make use of inferior second line machines and tanks.
