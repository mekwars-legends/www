The Capellan Confederation Armed Forces (CCAF) has grown significantly during the reign of Sun-Tzu Liao, with the majority of the growth coming from the integration of the MAF (Magistracy Armed Forces) and TDF (Taurian Defence Force) into a unified command following the alliance between the three realms. 

Known for their unconventional combat doctrines the Capellans prefer to disrupt their enemy with Artillery and mines before closing for combat. Recently the introduction of Shadow Lances, composed of stealth armor equipped units has further enhanced the Capellan reputation for unconventional warfare.

Recently the armed forces of the Taurian Concordat and Magistracy of Canopus have stepped up to aid their Capellan allies. While lacking the technological sophistication of their Capellan brothers these regiments should not be underestimated.
