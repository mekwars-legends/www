HEADQUARTERS TAB

The Headquarters tab is where you will be able to assign units to forces (armies) used to resolves battles via the Megamek client. The main feature of the Headquarters tab is your hanger where all the combat units under your command are graphically represented and may be sorted in a variety of ways at your discretion. 

Units in the headquarters tab may be customized by right clicking on them which will call up a customization menu allowing you to assign available pilots, customize the ammo load out and determine any autoeject settings for the unit. Please note that it is important that you follow all rules regarding the allowed amounts of special ammunitions for your faction found under Army composition rules, if you are not sure of the correct amounts check your quartermaster tab and check directly how many and what type of ammo factories that your faction currently has available.

Once you have pilots and ammo assigned to each unit the next step will be building your lances, stars, companies or whatever size forces you wish to battle with. This is done by creating the army via the Create New Army tab located just below your hanger. You may then add units to the army by either dragging and dropping a unit into the army or right clicking on the unit .
 

Note that a unit may not appear in more than a single army. Players may construct up to 15 armies at one time to be used as bids for the Matchmaking system. The minimum Battle Value (BV) allowed for an army is 8000 and players should be aware of this when planning their Mini Campaign. Building all of your armies at one time is a way to ensure that you will never be left with "loose" units at the end of a Mini Campaign that cannot make a high enough BV army to take advantage of the powerful Tactical Operations available near  the end of the Mini Campaign. Locked units (units that have already seen action during your current tactical campaign) are highlighted with a pink background and may not be added to armies or further interacted with in any way until unlocked during a players refit period. 

You must make any c3 and c3i links that you wish to use in games during the army setup in the headquarters tab. Once you are satisfied with your armies you are ready to head to activate your bids and find a game!
