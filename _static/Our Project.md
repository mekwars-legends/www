OUR PROJECT
We think the best way to describe what Mekwars: Legends as a community and a large BattleTech club. In spring of 2009 the project was started by a handful of BattleTech players that had never met each other face to face but had grown to respect each other through the great game of BattleTech.

Mekwars: Legends comes from a long line of Mekwars servers which are and were fan-run gaming clubs and projects that ran BattleTech campaigns using Megamek to resolve the battles. It was and continues to be a lot of fun, and these campaigns have provided for the communities that have grown up around them with hours of conversation, many laughs, a few tears and whole lot of fun.

It is our humble contribution to the legacy that the players that make up the great BattleTech community have all crafted on battlefields across time and space and imagination. Enjoy!

As always Mekwars: Legends is a full scale BattleTech campaign set in the canon universe circa 3067. The campaign features:

    Full Star Map of the Inner Sphere, 2000+ planets. 
    Full planetary conquest campaign with battles resolved via Megamek. 
    Specially balanced Matchmaking 
    8 playable campaign factions to join, each with sub-factions to join for even more Battle Tech flavor Deep strategic elements, make faction level decisions that affect the course of the campaign!!! 
    Scaling Battle Value system based on relative skill of opponents meant to allow newer players to compete with veterans. Factories and build tables set exactly to 3067 canon. 
    Open and friendly environment where you can hang out and play with fellow Battletech fans. Like us!


We are Battle Tech fans...no, Battletech fanatics! This is a volunteer, fan run project, run simply for "the love of the game" and as a thanks to all of the writers, designers and publishers that have given us such a great universe to dream and play in for 25+ years now! THANK YOU!
