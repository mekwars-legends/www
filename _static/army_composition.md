# General Army Composition

The Mekwars:Legends server seeks to provide a fair playing environment in which players may engage in a fun and exciting campaign that allows them to test their skills and luck against each other playing Battle Tech through Megamek. The server has always strove to balance heavy canon flavor with playability. Traditionally we have liked to keep the army composition rules simple as possible without compromising balance.

Even with restrictions kept to a minimum, you or your opponent may wish to disregard some or any of the composition rules presented  on this website. With the mutual consent of all involved in a particular game, any of the restrictions presented here may be lifted. This practice is approved and even encouraged by the staff - we want you to play with what you want to use, to field armies that represent the Battle Tech universe as you see it in your mind's eye.

The Army composition rules for the various unit types and munitions in 7th Campaign may be found on the menu to the left. However, players are also encouraged to follow the "golden rule" or to "do unto others as you would have done to you". Failure to do so generally will lead other players to shun playing you and in the end will take away from your own enjoyment. Remember we are all here to have fun and compete at the same time. Bear the above mentioned "golden rule" in mind when you construct armies to do battle. If the "golden rule" sounds a bit too preachy, consider this alternative rule.

> "Don't bring anything to the game that you would get punched in the face for, if your opponent was sitting across
from you".

A bit cruder of a message but equally effective.
